# Word Decomposition
## Or: How many words does it take to bootstrap the rest of the English Language?

# What.
Bootstrap as in `to construct something from existing pieces or systems`, not as in `framework`.

Let's take an arbitrary word and define it.

> **excel** _v._ to be very good at something

If we assume that the definition carries the equivalent meaning as the word, then the word was _bootstrapped_ via the existing words.

Remove it from our language of words and the lanuage's ability to communicate information does not change.

What happens if we keep going? If we find some core set of words which are either circularly defined or like leaf nodes.
